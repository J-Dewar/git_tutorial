# Getting started with github, git and R-studio.

### Creating a github account

Go to the github [website](http://github.com)

![Github website](figures/1.PNG)

and signup with your email and password.

![Github signup](figures/2.PNG)

Once you have a github site, in the upper left hand corner on your github site create a repository for where you want files from your pending project to go. Name the repository whatever you will be calling your project. Select to have a readme file where you can post notes about the project. Select to make it private while you are working on int (this can be changed later).

![Github new repository](figures/3.PNG)

Once you hit create you new repository should look something like this:

![terminal git version](figures/4.PNG)

## Getting started with git on your computer

Check if you have git installed on your computer. For this you have to use terminal to check. In your terminal write

git --version

and you should get back your version number.

If you do not have git on your computer you may have to install it. For instructions on how to check and install git on your computer see this very helpful [website](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html) or better yet this [manual](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)

## Setting up your project in R studio

Now that you have a github account and a local git on your computer you are ready to start working with git through R studio.

Open R-studio and start a new project. Choose a project with version control:

![Creating a version control project](figures/5.PNG)

Select the option to clone a repository from git. What R studio will then do is to clone the repository you created on github locally on your computer.

![Cloning the git repository](figures/6.PNG)

So that R-studio knows which github local repository to clone you have to specify an external url that matches your username and the name of the new repository that you just created on github (Repository URL).

You also have to specify where your local git files are going to be located see (Create project as subdirectory of:).

![Specifying location of external and local repositories](figures/7.PNG)

Hit the create button and R studio will create a project site that should look something like this. Notice how the files replicate what is in

![local files replicating external repository files](figures/9.PNG)

In case you run into trouble at this stage - and are not able to connect your files make sure that your local credentials (signup email matches the email you used to signup with github). To check this you can use:

```{r}
library(usethis)
edit_git_config()
```

Remember that you have to install the "usethis" package if it is not already on your computer.

If your git and hub have no problems communicating you can set about modifying your local files at will, adding files and changing them.

![Modifying local files](figures/10.PNG)

Each time you add a new file in your local directory or change it in some way it will appear in your git tab like so:

![Local files in Git tab](figures/11.PNG)

Notice that because I have not modified the README file that was imported from github this file does not appear in my git tab.

## Pushing files

The final step is to commit the changes I have made to my local files to the github repository. For this purpose I have to commit the files I want to update (I only commit the files I wish to update) and then I need to push them to the external repository.

To do this I first select the files that I want to commit. Next I hit the commit button.

![Local files in Git tab](figures/12.PNG)

When I hit the commit button another window pops up where I can write myself notes about the changes I am committing.

![Commit notes](figures/13.PNG)

Once I hit commit R-studio knows which local files I want to change in my external depository. Note that I can work locally and commit many files and then work on other files and commit them later. **Commit only commits changes to my files locally.** The last step then is to push all my locally committed files to my external repository.

From within my project I simply push the push button in my now empty git tab and my external repository is updated.

![Pushing changes to github](figures/14.PNG)

![Updated external repository](figures/15.PNG)

Github then tracks all of the changes in each file and new files added in each commit while also updating the main file.

This is very nice if you are working on a project - like a website that you might want to change frequently. You can simply open the project - make a change to any one part of the project and commit those changes to github. Imagine, for example, a website where you post new data and other information as it becomes available.

# Exercise

### Install git on your computer

### Create a github account

### Create a version control project in R studio and upload it to Github

# Working together in git.

One of the most useful things about github is the ability to work collaboratively.

## Associating your RStudio with a collaborative project

First, in order to work collaboratively, you may need to associate your RStudio with a project in GitHub that you did not create. If you created the project, do the following to add collaborators:

Go on the Github website to Settings \> Manage Access \> Invite a collaborator.

![Inviting Github Collaborations](figures/16.PNG)

Your teammate should accept the invite in their email.

Once this is complete, you can use the steps above to associate your RStuido with the GitHub project.

## Pulling Changes

One important aspect of collaboration in Github is the ability to pull changes. This allows you to update your code to align with changes pushed by collaborators.

Using the down arrow button, RStudio goes to the GitHub repo, grabs the most recent code and brings it into your local editor. (Pulling regularly is extremely important if you're collaborating, though if you're the only one working on an RStudio project and associated GitHub repo, you know your local code matches what's on GitHub so it's less important.)

To pull, click the blue down arrow on your Git tab to see if you have changes to pull. If collaborating, you might run into merge conflicts.

You can look to this [article](https://betterprogramming.pub/six-rules-for-good-git-hygiene-5006cf9e9e2) for other useful information for keeping good Git hygiene when collaborating.

Briefly the first four rules of thumb are:

### **Always Pull Before a Push**

#### **Pull frequently**

#### **Push infrequently**

#### **Commit Frequently**

## Branches

In order to create new branches, go to the 'git' tab on your RStudio console and click 'new branch'.

![](figures/git%20branch%20picture.png)

Then simply create the new branch and you're done.

Additionally the [article](https://betterprogramming.pub/six-rules-for-good-git-hygiene-5006cf9e9e2) discusses optimal git branch for working together.

#### **Merge "forward" frequently**

#### **Create Pull Requests Infrequently**

To better understand these

# Associating existing r studio projects with git

In order to associate an existing RStudio project with Git you will need to create a Git repository as described above and then follow the steps below.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(usethis)
use_git()
```

You will then get a prompt asking if you want to commit the files you've already created to your repo. Select yes (option 1). You should then also see the git tab.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(usethis)
create_github_token()
```

You will then get a number of options to select about what your token use case will be. This will be project-dependent.

You can learn more about the selections \[here\](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps) to help guide you in your process.

```{r}
#library(gitcreds) 
#gitcreds_set()
```

When prompted to enter a token or password, enter the token you just created. If you have entered one previously, you will be prompted to choose if you'd like to keep your credentials. If nothing has changed, select 1 and keep things as they are. If they have, follow the most applicable selection.
